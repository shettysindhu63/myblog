### Communicate to Connect
Effective Communication is an absolutely essential skill for data scientists. No matter what domain you are in, you need to communicate your work, results and insights with not only other data scientists but also people working closely with you like data engineers or business analysts, your supervisors, your collaborators, stakeholders and sometimes even the general public. So, it's only natural to take steps to improve your communication skills. 


### Importance of a safe platform 
But what if you fear public speaking and this is stopping you from taking the right steps forward ? First of all, this is a completely valid concern as most people are afraid of public speaking at least once in their lives. You can watch this ultra cool interactive video about neurons on anxiety called [Neurotic Neurons](http://ncase.me/neurons/). Although this video has a few simplifications as noted by the game developer [here](http://blog.ncase.me/neurotic-neurons-simplifications/), it gets the point across. *You need to expose yourself to what you are afraid of, but in a safe manner*. 


### NUS Toastmasters Club
This is exactly what **NUS Toastmasters Club** will do for you : provide a **safe platform** to practice public speaking and your communication skills. If you are  a beginner, you can be assured of finding a supportive and encouraging audience at every meeting. Even if you are somewhat comfortable with public speaking, you can still benefit from Toastmasters beyond just speaking in front of an audience. I have highlighted most of these in my article [Finding my voice at NUS TM](http://www.nustm.org/index.php/2015/09/14/finding-my-voice-at-nus-tm/) about my experience after one year with the NUS TM Club.

### Maximize your Time at Toastmasters
In this post, I want to provide some tips on how to leverage your time at Toastmasters to specifically work on skills that would be beneficial to people working with data. I usually like to prepare my project speeches on random, funny topics that are meant only to entertain the audience and nothing more (*because everyone needs a good laugh*). However, recently I have made a conscious effort to give more informative speeches that are related to my work or content that requires some data to be presented in various forms. Of course, a dash of humor is a given.  

Talking about my latest project speeches, my **Project 7 Research Your Topic** was about my own research work regarding thermal comfort in buildings titled "*Too Hot Outside, Too Cold Inside*". For my **Project 8 Get Comfortable with Visual Aids**, I presented about color theory and some real world examples where the design principles were used.

To maximize your time at Toastmasters for advancing your professional goals, I would suggest the following points that I have been trying out recently :

####1. Visualize your Data

This is pretty much Data 101. Project speeches in Toastmasters last between 5 to 7 minutes, so you don't have much time to talk about every little detail from your data or research. Also, you will most likely be speaking or presenting to a very diverse, non-academic audience. In my experience, one picture or chart per slide that clearly complements what you are talking about when that slide is on display and a limited number of slides (6-7 slides at most) work best. An additional tip is to blank out the screen and make the audience focus on you for the parts where you are not referring to the slides.  

Data scientists often complain how more time is spent on communicating and explaining the results with the stakeholders compared to developing the models or running the analysis. So, you can get better at this by practicing matching your presentation to the audience in Toastmasters which will hopefully save you some time to dive more into your data in the future.    

####2. Pitch your Work

NUS Toastmasters has a good mix of members from undergraduates, postgraduates to even alumni who are currently working. Members are from a variety of disciplines and industries. This is a great chance to engage with the members and talk about your work with people from different backgrounds. You will have to articulate it differently for every group of members and you can get immediate feedback if you could get your message across. You could be more specific with people from your domain and more general with others.

For example, in a recent meeting, I discussed about what kind of machine learning techniques I have used with a fellow graduate student who also works with these methods. With other members, I usually adopt a more general tone saying that I focus on improving personal comfort in buildings through collecting and analyzing data. I am not particularly great at shifting tones quickly but I am getting better with practice and it's becoming easier to share about what I do and connect with the other members without drowning them in details.     

####3. Evaluate to Upgrade

Evaluate, evaluate and then evaluate some more. As an evaluator, you listen to a member's speech and then give the speaker feedback on what was done well and what could have been better in a 2-3 minutes speech of your own in the same meeting. Evaluating more helps you improve your listening skills, critical thinking skills and the ability to quickly condense your feedback into a short speech. All of these are incredibly helpful when you have to critique other works and vocalize your feedback in a constructive manner. 

Personally, it has helped me internalize the evaluating process so I know what to look for and how to provide constructive feedback to the speakers. Perhaps, the greatest benefit is that evaluating more will help you in preparing your own speeches better as you get to know what works and what doesn't.

If you want to know more about Toastmasters, you can check out [NUS TM](http://www.nustm.org/) and [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/) websites. For graduate students like myself, I think Toastmasters is a great excuse to get out of the lab and meet real humans. And practice your communication skills while you're at it.
