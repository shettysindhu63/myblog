Previously I compiled some examples and resources on interactive visualizations. In this post, I am listing a few more that are really interesting especially explorable explanations. 

Explorables 

I am a fan of explorable explanations, they recently revamped the site to include tools and tutorials, especially check out Nicky Case's article on the thought process behind creating an explorable explanation and bret victor whose talks are really inspiring. I also came across ChalkTalk (still in early stages I think) which could be quite useful for exploring solutions by collaborating with the audience during presentations. 

Machine learning 

Recently, there is a lot of discussion regarding interpretability and explaining model predictions. Here's an article from Distill on feature visualization and here is a good example of explaining a complex concept with visual examples. There has also been a rise in the number of tools and frameworks that can help in explaining the models. LIME can do this. RNNVis can do this.  


Stuff from Singapore 

If you are from Singapore, its likely you heard about the (circle line fault) it was all over the news. Use of Marey Chart was quite interesting. You may also find (Swarm) interesting, with what happens when different lines breakdown.
