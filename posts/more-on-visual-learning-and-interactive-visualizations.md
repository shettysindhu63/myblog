In a previous [post](https://shettysindhu63.github.io/myblog/posts/interactive-visualizations-examples-and-resources/), I compiled some examples and resources on interactive visualizations. In this post, I am listing a few more that are quite interesting and useful. 

<br>
**Explorable Explanations**


<br>
I am a fan of [explorable explanations](http://explorabl.es/), the revamped site includes tools and tutorials to make your own explorables. Check out [Nicky Case's post](http://blog.ncase.me/how-i-make-an-explorable-explanation/) on the thought process behind creating an explorable explanation and [Bret Victor's article](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/) on what it means to be an active reader. I recently came across [Chalktalk](https://github.com/kenperlin/chalktalk/) which is like an interactive blackboard for exploring solutions by collaborating with the audience during presentations, read this [article](http://cognitivemedium.com/interfaces-1/index.html) for more information.

**Machine Learning** 

<br>
Lately, there has been a lot of discussion around interpretability and explaining model predictions. There has also been a rise in the number of tools and frameworks that can help in explaining model predictions through visualization or other methods. [LIME](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/introduction-to-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime) seems to be a popular framework especially used by data scientists in industry. [Distill](https://distill.pub/) has an article on [feature visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/) to explain how neural networks build up their understanding of images. [RNNVis](http://www.myaooo.com/projects/rnnvis/) is a recent project that helps visualize the hidden states of recurrent neural networks, this project is under active development. The [studio otoro](http://blog.otoro.net/) blog is great for generative design and machine learning research articles with lots of visual examples.

**Side Note: interesting stuff from Singapore** 

<br>
If you are in Singapore, it's likely you have heard about the mysterious Circle Line fault that was all over the news. [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) has a [detailed post](https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a) on how this issue was solved which includes the use of a not-so-common Marey chart. Also, check out this really cool visualization using [isochrone map of Singapore](https://isochrone.swarm.is/) to show public transport accessibility. If you want to know more about isochrone maps, you can read [Yin Shanyang's post](https://medium.com/@yinshanyang/isochronic-singapore-a-gentle-introduction-to-isochrone-maps-9cceebc72f60).

To wrap-up this post, here's a comprehensive visualization catalog with code templates: [The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) and here's something for inspiration: [Dear Data Project](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject).
