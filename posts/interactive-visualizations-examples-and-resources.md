Recently, I came across the article [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) which talks about how increasing the effort in clear explanations can exponentially reduce the effort in understanding concepts and research work for researchers. I really admire visualizations that are made not just to impress, but to engage the readers and help them gain an intuition by exploring the concepts or methods from many different angles. I compile some of such examples here and also some of the tools that could be used to create such visualizations or web pages.

**Learning through interactive visualizations**

**Tools to create interactive visualizations**

<br>

Many of the visualizations are created with Mike Bostock's [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) JavaScript library and  Jim Vallandingham's [ScrollyTeller](http://vallandingham.me/scroller.html) code. Below are few other resources that might be useful. 

- [Creating educational gifs with R](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/08/08/code-for-my-educational-gifs/)

- [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [plotly](https://plot.ly/), [Lightning](http://lightning-viz.org/)

- [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com/), [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](http://datavizcatalogue.com/)

<br>
Making interactive visualizations is not only useful for the final presentation of your analysis but also incredibly useful during the exploratory data analysis stage. I usually use [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) in Jupyter notebooks for this purpose. Recently, [Google PAIR](https://ai.google/pair) released the [FACETS](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) tool for data exploration which could also help to this end. 

<br>
To wrap-up this post, have a look at these wonderful visualizations : [Stitch Fix Algorithms Tour](http://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/) and [Visual Cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio).
