#### Hello, world !

In my first post, I would just like to highlight **why** I started this blog, **what** to expect and **how** I set up this blog. 


### The Why 

I am writing this blog mostly for myself as a means to keep track of the resources and tools I find useful for my work. Also, I think it's a great excuse to write more and improve my writing. I consider myself a beginner and through this blog, I want to research on how to do things better, polish my skills and reinforce what I am learning. 

Personally, I have benefited from a lot of blogs (mostly related to data science tools) that helped me when I was stuck. If the content here helps others like myself in untangling some of the information out there, I will be delighted. If I manage to get constructive feedback from advanced users in the field, that would be the best and I will consider myself very lucky.

### The What 

With the articles I have in mind right now, the blog will be roughly about the following categories :


- Tools/resources that helped me get to the data and analysis quicker and avoid spending too much time on how to get everything to work. 

- Useful libraries/packages in R and Python mainly for data cleaning, data manipulation and exploratory data analysis.
 
- Occasionally about productivity or organization tools like Evernote and Trello and other stuff I find interesting such as Interactive Data Visualization.

- Effective communication skills and my experience with NUS Toastmasters. 

This is a rough sketch and I hope to write about more things in the future.

### The How 

I started this blog using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) as the static site generator and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment. 
I am looking for a commenting system and leaning towards [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), more updates on that later. 


I guess that's all for the first post. **Goodbye, World !** (for now)
