I want to share on some apps that have helped me reduce overwhelm, organize stuff and stay on track. 

<br>
### [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) 
Evernote is my main note-taking app. I just put in any project ideas, research ideas, troubleshooting tips, blog post drafts, receipts or even random thoughts. One tip is to use tags more extensively over multiple notebooks. For e.g, I save any new blog idea with `blog content` tag and any updates to change the blog theme or appearance itself with `blog main` and so on. I used the free version for a long time but recently upgraded to the Plus version mostly for syncing across more than two devices and sending some emails directly to Evernote account to save as a new note.

### [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) 
I use Feedly to organize my reading to keep abreast of the advances in the field. I set up few feeds for each set of blogs, e.g. Data Science & Analytics related feed, Machine Learning and AI feed and so on. I really like the **Boards** feature which I use to save articles for future reference under specific board themes like Guides & Refreshers for tutorial articles and cheatsheets, Data Stories for articles describing use-cases or the whole pipeline of a single data science project. You could also use the **Read Later** feature, I tend to use this less often than **Boards** and only save general stuff that does not fit into any of the Boards. 

<br>
### [Trello](https://trello.com/)
I use Trello mostly for laying out goals at the start of the year or any long-term goals both personal and professional. My favourite features are the **colored labels** and **attaching links**. You can add reminders, take note that you need to be subscribed to the card if you want to receive notifications before a due date. I usually have few regular main boards and start a separate board for a current project or some involved task which I archive after it's done. One more fun feature is that you can add different background pictures for different boards.

### [Slack](https://slack.com/) 
I recently started using Slack to join the [R for Data Science slack community](https://medium.com/@kierisi/join-the-r-for-data-science-online-learning-community-842527222ab3) but ended up using it more on a daily basis as a personal workspace. This [article](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/using-slack-as-a-personal-knowledge-hub-43ae0b139c5b) on using Slack as a personal knowledge hub is similar to how I am using Slack right now. I have a channel `#current_research` in which I keep updating the daily tasks and whatever things come up when I am working on my thesis project. I also use integrations like a `#twitter-feed` channel to store my favorited tweets and tweets from a particular user or hashtag, a `#meetup` channel for getting a meetup notification as soon as it's posted and a Trello integration to send any starred message to a Trello board. It's great to have a searchable archive of information in one place without jumping from one app to another. I am really liking the slackbot `remind` feature, I end up putting all of my reminders in here these days.
