There are many tutorials, courses on both fundamental concepts and the skills, tools required for data science. However, it is often difficult to find simple, useful and practical guidelines on the workflow of the data analysis process and what you will actually be doing on a daily basis in order to keep improving. 


Occasionally, I would find a blog post or youtube video that tries to talk about the process and failures. I also learned a lot from talking to data scientists in local meetups. I have collated some points below both from experience with my own failings and from listening to others works.
 

**Data over algorithms**

**Visualize to realize**

**Keep up to date with packages**

**Define your metrics upfront**

**Match data to expectations**
