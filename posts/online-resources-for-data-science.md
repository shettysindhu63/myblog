*Disclaimer : This is in no way a curated list of resources. These are just the ones I have found most helpful in simplifying some of the workflows I follow on a regular basis or providing intuitive explanations of concepts and techniques.*   

*This list may be updated in the future*

I have separated this post into few categories and included a short *what-it-is-and-how-it is-useful* description for each resource.
