*Disclaimer : This is in no way a curated list of resources. These are just the ones I have found most helpful in simplifying some of the workflows I follow on a regular basis or providing intuitive explanations of concepts and techniques.*   

*This list may be updated in the future*

I have separated this post into few categories and included a short *what-it-is-and-how-it is-useful* description for each resource.

### Online Courses and Tutorials
- [Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University , Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
	
	This course got me started with R programming when I knew nothing about it. Also, I keep going back to the *Regression Models* and *Statistical Inference* sections to refresh the concepts. 

- [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science, Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)

	Comprehensive and easy-to-follow course on machine learning which packs a lot of content. The instructors don't go into the details of the algorithms but the intuitive explanations at the beginning of each section is good enough to get you started. My favorite part of the course is the code templates which I use in daily work and saved me a lot of time. 

- [Google Developers Python Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk&list=PL123FD827C7984559)

	Tutorials on basics of Python that I use as a refresher material. These videos serve as a good intro to Python if you already have some programming experience but not in Python.  

- [Statistics for Research Projects](http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/)
	
	Concise and intuitive notes on how to choose the right statistical analyses and experiment design for your research projects. Great for students like myself who are not Statistics majors. 
	

### Blogs 
- [7 Steps to Mastering Machine Learning With Python, KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/11/seven-steps-machine-learning-python.html)
	
	KDnuggets is a well-known data science blog. This article in particular provides a structured framework to improve both your machine learning and Python skills. Really good if you are feeling stuck in your learning process, just follow the steps outlined. 

- [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/)

	This is a statistics blog by the same JHU professors who teach the Data Science specialization course in Coursera.

- [Colah's Blog](http://colah.github.io/) and [Adit Deshpande's Blog](https://adeshpande3.github.io/)
	
	I am recently trying my hand at deep learning. These two blogs have clear and intuitive explanations as well as beautiful visualizations that help you understand the concepts better. 


### Books

- [The Art of Data Science](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience), Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui

	This short book was extremely helpful for defining what I do on a daily basis and guiding the next step in the data analysis process whenever I am feeling stuck. I even have a short summary of the book for myself to keep reviewing and try to internalize the Epicycle of Data Analysis. 

- [Data Science for Business](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking-ebook/dp/B00E6EQ3X4/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=), Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett

	Good for learning how to break down business or real world problems into smaller data science problems that we know how to solve using existing methods. I was able to better formulate my research project with smaller data science or machine learning problems  with more clarity using the concepts from this book.  

- [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
	
	Currently reading this book. It is available for free online. 

### Extras

- [Rules Of Machine Learning](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf)

	Practical guidelines on deployment and refinement of machine learning models in real-world systems with best practices from around Google.

- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)

 	Solutions to the same task in as many different programming languages.
