For a comprehensive explanation, read the book &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"&gt;blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a writeup on steps I took to setup a &lt;a href="https://sindhu.netlify.com/"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/"&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; to write the posts and project summaries in R Markdown. Since most of my projects are in R, I thought it would be good idea to setup a site for my project portfolio as well as more polished blog posts on use-cases for R packages and tutorials. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on blogdown by the package author Yihui Xie, the process was quite smooth excluding the part where I took a whole day in selecting the theme (this was due to my indecisiveness). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective Communication is an absolutely essential skill for data scientists. No matter what domain you are in, you need to communicate your work, results and insights with not only other data scientists but also people working closely with you like data engineers or business analysts, your supervisors, your collaborators, stakeholders and sometimes even the general public. So, it's only natural to take steps to improve your communication skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Importance of a safe platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you fear public speaking and this is stopping you from taking the right steps forward ? First of all, this is a completely valid concern as most people are afraid of public speaking at least once in their lives. Recently, I came across this interactive video about neurons on anxiety called &lt;a href="http://ncase.me/neurons/"&gt;Neurotic Neurons&lt;/a&gt;. Although this video has a few simplifications as noted by the game developer &lt;a href="http://blog.ncase.me/neurotic-neurons-simplifications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it gets the point across. &lt;em&gt;You need to expose yourself to what you are afraid of, but in a safe manner&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
