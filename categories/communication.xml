&lt;p&gt;Effective Communication is an absolutely essential skill for data scientists. No matter what domain you are in, you need to communicate your work, results and insights with not only other data scientists but also people working closely with you like data engineers or business analysts, your supervisors, your collaborators, stakeholders and sometimes even the general public. So, it's only natural to take steps to improve your communication skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Importance of a safe platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you fear public speaking and this is stopping you from taking the right steps forward ? First of all, this is a completely valid concern as most people are afraid of public speaking at least once in their lives. Recently, I came across this interactive video about neurons on anxiety called &lt;a href="http://ncase.me/neurons/"&gt;Neurotic Neurons&lt;/a&gt;. Although this video has a few simplifications as noted by the game developer &lt;a href="http://blog.ncase.me/neurotic-neurons-simplifications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it gets the point across. &lt;em&gt;You need to expose yourself to what you are afraid of, but in a safe manner&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
